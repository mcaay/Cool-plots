I handpicked particular foods based on my research and experience. These are either foods which allow you to get your vitamin C most easily (red bell peppers, oranges, broccoli) or popular foods that have less vitamin C than most people would expect (tomatoes, apples, blueberries).

I used Recommended Daily Allowance for men - 90 mg (for women it is less - 75 mg). There are reasons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVR06qdg1_k) to suspect though that 200 mg is a better amount to be getting - then the adjusted plot would look like this https://imgur.com/iWeZZhm.

Values in grams (peel not accounted for):

1 medium red bell pepper - 119 g

1 medium orange - 131 g

1/2 medium broccoli - 90 g

1/2 cup strawberries - 76 g

1 medium tomato - 123 g

1 medium banana - 118 g

1 medium apple - 182 g

1/2 cup blueberries - 74 g
